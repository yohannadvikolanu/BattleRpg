# Content
The repository contains the Unity project built to demonstrate the concepts of a Hero Battle Rpg.
Features implemented are listed below:
- âœ… Each hero has attributes like name, health, attack power, experience and level.
- âœ… A hero collection structure to keep all collected heroes and select them for battle.
- âœ… A player having the ability to collect upto 10 different heroes.
- âœ… A new player gets 3 random heroes.
- âœ… A player selects 3 heroes to enter a battle.
- âœ… When battle is initiated, battlefield is generated with 3 heroes on left and 1 enemy on right.
- âœ… Player can tap on any hero to peform an attack.
- âœ… The enemy performs an attack on a random hero, after the player's turn.
- âœ… Only 1 hero or enemy can attack at a time.
- âœ… The Battle finishes when all heroes health attributes are 0 or enemy's health attribute is 0.
- âœ… Every battle won will increase any alive hero's (health > 0) experience attribute +1.
- âœ… When battle finishes, the status of the battle is conveyed to the player (win or lose).
- âœ… Every 5th enemy battle (does not matter whether these are wins or losses) will give a random hero until playerâ€™s hero count reaches to 10.
- âœ… Every 5 experience points increases heroâ€™s level +1 automatically.
- âœ… Each Level increase will increase heroâ€™s attack point and health attributes by 10%.
- âœ… If a hero is tapped and hold for 3 seconds it will display info popup on both hero selection and battlefield screens.

# Testing Platform
The project has been tested in Editor and on an Android device. 
- ðŸ“± Device Name - OnePlus 7T
- ðŸ“± OS Name - Oxygen OS
- ðŸ“± Android version - 11
- ðŸ“± Build number - 11.0.9.1.HD65AA

# Things to improve on
- ðŸŸ¡ Heroes are hardcoded. Dynamic generation or more heroes to pick from will be the next step.
- ðŸŸ¡ Revisit the technique I've used to animate the objects. While this works, it feels a bit messy. Could be cleaner.
- ðŸŸ¡ Add a bit more variability to the hurt animations to add some polish.
- ðŸŸ¡ Make the battles a bit harder by making the enemy metrics tougher.
